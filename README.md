#  NodeJS Challenge
This was a NodeJS/Express JS challenge taken for a recruitment process, the task being to create an API endpoint for user logins based on specific instructions. The API has two endpoints:
/login, a GET request that returns an object containing a username and a password, which were hard coded and stored in a module file.
/users, a GET request that returns an array of objects based on the JSON Placeholder user data, saved as a JSON file. 

# Instructions
To run the server, clone the repository and navigate to the root folder in the console. Run the command "node app.js" to start the server, which will be available on localhost:3000 if possible. The two endpoints can be accessed at localhost:3000/login and localhost:3000/users, through a web browser or through an app such as Postman.
